 CHANGES
=========

1.0.1 (unreleased)
==================

- Additional fixes for Python 3 compatibility.

  NOTE: The error view base classes now set a Content-Type response header to
  "text/plain". If your error view subclassing from the zope.errorview classes
  return a response body other than "text/plain" you need to explicitly set
  the Content-Type in your views.

1.0.0 (2017-05-10)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and PyPy.

- Fix typo in Dutch translation

0.11 (2011-06-28)
=================

- Added nl translations.

0.10 (2011-02-08)
=================

- Exception views do not by default provide ISystemErrorView anymore as it
  would result in duplicate log output. The mixin class still exists for
  writing custom error views that do provide ISystemErrorView.

0.9 (2011-01-20)
================

- Initial release.
